##### Description:

This plugin strips all streams from the source video other than video and audio streams - all subtitles, attachements, data streams are removed.
Note that this is a very destructive plugin - all streams other than audio and video will be removed - it will also remove any chapters.
However, if there are multiple audio and/or multiple video streams, all of those streams will remain intact.

### Config description:

There is a single option to extract subtitles - which it will convert to srt (subrip) format.  this will probably not work with image subtitles.
The subtitle files will be extracted to the directory of the original file.
