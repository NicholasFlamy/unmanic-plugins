##### Description:

This plugin adds an external subtitle file into the video file of the same name, e.g, if a subtitle file named "video_file.xx.srt" exists in a folder and there is also a video file named "video_file.mp4" or a video file named
"video_file.mkv" then the plugin will add the contents of "video_file.xx.srt" as a subtitle stream with language tags of "xx" to "video_file.mp4" or "video_file.mp4".  It will add the srt subtitle stream as is to mkv files
and it will transcode the srt to mov_text format if it's an mp4 file.
