##### Description:

This plugin strips all streams from the source video other than video and audio streams - all subtitles, attachements, data streams are removed.
Note that this is a very destructive plugin - all streams other than audio and video will be removed - it will also remove any chapters.
However, if there are multiple audio and/or multiple video streams, all of those streams will remain intact.
